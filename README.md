Project Title: Sofitra Book Store – Online Library & Book Management

SystemShort Description:

Sofitra Book Store is a simple and user-friendly web application that allows visitors to browse books, buy
them, contact the store, and create their own accounts. The main pages such as Contact Us, Buy Books,
Create Account, and Payment are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a clean and smooth
browsing experience. Login and signup features are handled with PHP to ensure secure and reliable
server-side processing.
The project uses MySQL as its main database, storing important information like user accounts, book
details, and purchase records. PHP communicates directly with the MySQL database so that every action
whether logging in or making a purchase happens safely, efficiently, and with accurate data handling.

Environment Requirements:
• Visual Studio Code: for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP
• PhpMyAdmin: for Database
• XAMPP: for MySQL management
